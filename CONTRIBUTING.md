# Contributing

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This guide explains how to propose changes, report issues, and submit pull requests in a clear and consistent way.

## Ways to Contribute
You can help by:
- Reporting bugs (unexpected behavior, crashes, incorrect output)
- Fixing bugs (small or large)
- Improving documentation (README, examples, comments, typos)
- Suggesting enhancements (new features, refactors, performance improvements)
- Sharing ideas (roadmap suggestions, usability improvements)

## Before You Start
- Please read the **README** to understand the project goals and usage.
- Check the **Issues** tab to see if your bug/idea already exists.
- If you’re planning a big change, open an issue first so we can discuss the approach.

## Reporting Bugs
When opening a bug report, include as much of the following as possible:

**Bug report template**
- **Summary:** What happened?
- **Expected behavior:** What should have happened?
- **Steps to reproduce:** A numbered list of steps
- **Screenshots/logs:** If available
- **Environment:** OS, tool/runtime version(s), and any relevant config
- **Additional context:** Anything else that helps

## Suggesting Enhancements & Ideas
Enhancement requests are welcome. Please include:
- **Problem:** What pain point are you solving?
- **Proposed solution:** What you want to happen
- **Alternatives:** Other options you considered
- **Impact:** Who benefits and how
- **Scope:** Small/medium/large (rough estimate)

## Improving Documentation
Documentation PRs are encouraged!
- Fix typos, clarity, or formatting
- Add examples or screenshots
- Improve onboarding steps for new contributors
- Keep language simple and consistent

## Submitting Changes (Pull Requests)
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your change:
   - `fix/short-description`
   - `docs/short-description`
   - `feat/short-description`
3. **Make your changes** with clear commits.
4. **Test** your changes (and add tests if applicable).
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** with a clear description.

### PR Description Checklist
In your PR, include:
- What you changed (and why)
- Which issue it fixes (if any): `Fixes #123`
- How you tested it (steps or commands)
- Screenshots (for UI changes), if relevant

## Commit & PR Guidelines
- Keep commits focused and meaningful.
- Use clear messages, for example:
  - `fix: handle null input in parser`
  - `docs: clarify installation steps`
  - `feat: add export to JSON`
- Follow existing style and naming conventions in the project.
- Avoid unrelated formatting changes in the same PR (keep diffs clean).

## Code Quality Checklist
Before submitting:
- [ ] Builds/runs without errors
- [ ] Existing tests pass (if the project has tests)
- [ ] New tests added for new behavior (when applicable)
- [ ] No secrets or private keys included
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior or usage changes

## Getting Help
If you’re stuck:
- Open an issue with your question and what you tried so far.
- Add any error messages/logs to help others reproduce the problem.
